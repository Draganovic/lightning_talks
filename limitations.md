#Realizing Our Limitations

###People seem to be logical and noble
*How people view the economy
*Historical financial collapses
*Is it us or our environment
(picture 1.a)
(picture1.b)

###How the systems and tools we create fail us
*The environments we create are too complex for us to understand

###How monkeys behave in the market
*Monkeys and larceny
*Status quo - Reference is important and deceptive
*looks like will give 3 / gives 2 and looks like will give 1 / gives 2
(picture3)

###Monkeys behave like us in the market
*Smart monkey economy 
*Shouldnt care about the difference if we are being rational
*Loss Adverse
*When faced with loss you are more likely to make poor choices

###When you are about to make financial decisions ask yourself WWMD
*Know your limitations and never assume your gut reaction is logical
