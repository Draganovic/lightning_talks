###People seem to be logical and noble
**How people view the economy
**Historical financial collapses
**Is it us or our environment

###How the systems and tools we create fail us
**The environments we create are too complex for us to understand

###How monkeys behave in the market
**Monkeys and larceny
**Status quo - Reference is important and deceptive
**looks like will give 3 / gives 2 and looks like will give 1 / gives 2

###Monkeys behave like us in the market
**Smart monkey economy 
**Shouldnt care about the difference if we are being rational
**Loss Adverse- Pospect theory - Humans are hardwired to avoid losses 
**When faced with loss you are more likely to make poor choices
